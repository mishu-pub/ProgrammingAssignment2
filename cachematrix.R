## A couple of  functions that enable the caching of computation of the inverse of a matrix


## This function creates a special object matrix that can be cached
## the cache is actually another enviroment

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## this function takes as an argument the special cacheable matrix and computes the inverse
## if inverse was not already computed it computes it and then caches it so that on further
## calls it can be directly retrieved from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
